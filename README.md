# hello-world
First class assignment for Code Louisville.

# About me
- My name is Euclides Jose Vezga, I go by Jose Vezga for simplicity.
- I'm originally from Venezuela.
- I'm 27 years old.
- I'm passionate about coding, anytime I have the opportunity to develop any automatization I get a lot of fun out of the process.

I hope I can get to participate in Code Louisville, I have some self-thought knowledge of programming and programming languages like Python, VBA, and Lua. I'm looking for a structured way of learning with a focused learning path and I want to get involved in the coding community of my new city.
